## "meh alas, you person" - 👍👍👍

many ppl call their github bio "my corner of the internet". idk why they do that, its not true. that corner of the internet still belongs to github, no matter what you put there. 
the only fix for this would be to hack the github servers or smthn and actually put your own stuff there, or to DNS spoof something like cloudfalre dns and replace the ip its pointing to with ur own server. that would not affect all people though, bcuz apparently there are weirdos not using cloudflare DNS. to satisfy these weirdos with a nice "dis is meh corner of da internet" html page, u'd need to DNS spoof all DNS servers in the world, or you try to change everyones DNS setting to use cloudfalre DNS. sadly thats illegal and u'd go to jail forever.

idk what to say now :P <br>
i dont like speling its not useful<br>
